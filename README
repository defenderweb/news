Specific Q's for Nick
=====================

When a User is logged in, how can i have the user_id set to that user when creating a new Press Release?
	i.e. From their profile, they would click "New Press Release" and "Contact" would be set to them.



ToDo's
======

Refactor brand to use parent_id instead of the parent name
